            <strong>Welcome to REPNT Clothing.</strong>
            <p>This isn’t just fashion—it’s faith in motion.</p>
            <p>REPNT is a Christian streetwear brand built to represent truth, purpose, and bold belief. Every piece we drop is designed to make a statement—about who you are and who you live for. We believe in turning heads, not just with style, but with the message of Christ.</p>
            <p>Whether you're in the city, at church, or just living life, wear your faith loud. This is more than clothing. It’s a calling.</p>
            <p>Thanks for being part of the REPNT movement.</p>
